# PROBLEM STATEMENT-
1- Our E-learning portal gives students an opportunity to connect to mentors
from different parts of the world and to learn from their experiences. It will
also works as a peer to peer network, that lets students help each other out
through a community of similar interest.

2. This portal provides ex-employers with an opportunity to earn an
additional income and a chance to help the young students and developerswho are seeking their help. This would also help them sharpen/revise their
skills. Also through the platform top-performing candidates, gets an
opportunity to land in an interview with a recruiter of their choice.

3. Recruiters find to hard to find the right candidates from the plethora of
applicants. Our Portal provides recruiters the opportunity to connect with our
top-performing candidates (who have passed our skill verification test). Thus
instead of taking the hazzle of going through long process of hiring, the
recruiters can go through the handful of potential candidates on this portal by
accepting to connect with them.

# NOVELTY-
1. Students can directly intern under their own mentors and after passing
particular test/level they can apply for job with some of their known recruiters
based on a point system.
2. Users can post about the project idea they need assistance/help for (or any
other issue they want help in) . Other users experienced in the related
technologies can choose to work on these projects/issues as a team member
or as a mentor and can review the progress using this portal.
3. Users can maintain a timetable for all the courses and tests and get reminders
before the scheduled time. They can also get their skills verified by taking skill
tests and if they perform well, they receive amazing gifts for like event passes,
vouchers, scratch cards etc.
4. Recruiters can look into shortlisted top candidate's/employers profile who
applied and accept to connect with these potential candidates. And if
convinced, they can directly offer an interview for any of the current job
openings in their firm.
5. A community maintained for similar minded people like Student community,
Employer community, Recruiter community and a common platform to
connect all three.
